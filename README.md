# Parstagram
Built a replica of the popular social media platform Instagram using Xcode, incorporating features such as user authentication, image and video uploads, likes and comments, and a visually appealing user interface. The project utilized advanced techniques in mobile app development, including RESTful APIs, Swift programming, and integration with Firebase for real-time data storage and retrieval. The end result was a well-designed and functional social media app that provided users with a similar experience to the original Instagram app.
